How to use:


Either build the DLL using source files in Visual Studio (requires KHMI.dll from https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KHMI/tree/master for linking), or you can just take the prebuilt DLL from the LatestRelease file.

Afterwards, you should get KHMI (https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KHMI/tree/master) and place the aforementioned DLL in the mods folder generated when you first run KHMI.
